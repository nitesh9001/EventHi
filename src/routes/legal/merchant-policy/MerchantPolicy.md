1.3 Disclaimer & Acknowledgment.

EVENTHI IS NOT A MEDICAL CANNABIS COLLECTIVE OR COOPERATIVE (“DISPENSARY”) AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY CANNABIS SERVICES TO MEDICAL, RECREATIONAL CANNABIS USERS.

4.. EventHi's Role.

4.1 Listing Service and Limited Agent. 

EventHi is not the organizer or owner of the events listed for sale or registration on the Services. EventHi also acts as the Organizer’s limited agent solely for the purpose of using its third-party payment providers to collect payments made by Attendees and Sponsors on the Services with respect to an event and passing such payments through to the applicable Organizer. It is the Organizer’s sole obligation to ensure that any event page posting on the Services and the nature and conduct of the underlying event meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services described in any event page posting are actually delivered in a satisfactory
manner. 

4.2 Fees. 

Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services is free. We charge our fees only when you sell or buy paid tickets or registrations. All descriptions of standard fees on the Services represent the standard fees that EventHi charges to Organizers. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between EventHi and certain Organizers. Organizers ultimately choose if these fees will be passed along to Attendees and shown as “Fees” on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket or registration price and paid by the Organizer out of ticket and registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Attendees may include certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfillment fees. Therefore, the fees paid by Attendees for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by EventHi to the applicable Organizer or the standard fees described on the Services to Organizers. In addition, certain fees are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by EventHi, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss. EventHi does not control (and thus cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all applicable fees, credit card surcharges, and currency conversion rates. 

4.4 Refunds. 

Because all transactions are between an Organizer and its respective Attendees, EventHi asks that all Attendees contact the applicable Organizer of their event with any refund requests. Organizers agree to post and maintain a refund policy on each event page, and that refund policy will govern, provided that the refund policy must be consistent with EventHI’s Attendee Refund Policy Requirements available here. In the event that an Organizer has not responded to a refund request within two (2) business days or there is a dispute between an Organizer and an Attendee that cannot be resolved, either party may contact EventHi. EventHi may, in its discretion, attempt to mediate such dispute, however, EventHi will have no liability for (a) an Organizer’s failure to give refunds; (b) EventHi’s failure to mediate a dispute; or (c) EventHi’s decision if it does mediate the dispute.

6.2 Security. 

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account details and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including without limitation, all actions by sub-users registered under your account. You agree to immediately notify EventHi of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. 

6.3 Age Restrictions. 

EventHi is concerned about the safety and privacy of children. For this reason, and to be consistent with the terms of use of any third party service providers used by EventHi, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the legal age of majority where you reside, to use the Services. Otherwise, you may use the Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. In any event, you may not use the Services if you are under the age of eighteen (18).

All Feedback and Revisions become the sole and exclusive property of EventHi and EventHi may use and disclose Feedback and/or Revisions in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever without further notice or compensation to you and without retention by you of any proprietary or other right or claim.

You hereby agree to waive any moral rights you may have in any and all Feedback and Revisions, and consent to any act which amounts to an infringement of any such moral right, in favor of EventHi. At EventHi’s request, you will execute any document, registration or filing required to give effect to these provisions.

9.. Service Modifications.

We are constantly evolving our products and services to better meet the needs of our entire user base. Because of this, we do not guarantee any set of product features or functionality and reserve the right at any time to, and from time to time may, modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the Services for any reason. Because you only pay fees to EventHi as you use the Services, there would be no refund of fees already due following any such change to the Services.

10.. Links.

10.1 Third Party Websites. 

The Services may provide, or Users may provide, links to other Internet websites or resources. Because EventHi has no control over such websites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that EventHi is not responsible for the availability of such websites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such websites or resources, or any damages or losses related thereto, even if such websites or resources are connected with EventHi partners or third-party service providers.

Such content may include personally identifiable information.


11.. Privacy; Customer Information.

11.1 Privacy Policy. 

All information provided by Users or collected by EventHi in connection with the Services is governed by EventHi’s Privacy Policy, a copy of which is located here. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Service by reference. EventHi strongly recommends that you review the Privacy Policy. 

11.2 Co-Ownership. 

EventHi follows a “co-ownership model” with respect to Attendee, Sponsor, Information (as defined below). This means that all Attendee, Sponsor Information inputted by an Attendee on event pages posted by an Organizer on the Services will be shared with the applicable Organizer and may also be used by EventHi in accordance with our Privacy Policy, including marketing or promotion of other events or services that may be of interest to the applicable Attendee. Note that Payment Data (as defined below) will not be shared with Organizers. Each Attendee acknowledges and agrees to this sharing and understands and agrees that each Organizer is solely responsible for the use of Attendee Information that was provided to such Organizer through the Services and that EventHi is responsible only for its own use of Attendee Information. Each Organizer represents, warrants and agrees that (a) it will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations with respect to Attendee Information; (b) it will at all times comply with any applicable policies posted on the Services with respect to Attendee, Sponsor Information; and (c) upon a request of a given Attendee, Sponsor or as permitted in Section 8.2 of these Terms of Use, EventHi is authorized at its discretion to delete or anonymize Attendee, Sponsor Information of a requesting Attendee, Sponsor from the Services at which time it will no longer be available to Organizer through the Services or will no longer be linked to an identifiable Attendee, Sponsor through the Services. However, Attendees and Sponsor should note that Attendee, Sponsor Information may still be available in the Organizer’s own databases if transmitted prior to EventHi receiving the underlying request. For purposes of this Section, “Attendee and Sponsor Information” means information about a given Attendee or Sponsor made available on or through the Services, including, without limitation, name, address, e-mail address, web address, past event attendance, event interests, credit card type, last 4 credit card digits and phone numbers, EIN number, but excluding Payment Data. 

11.3 Payment Data. 

EventHi will not share with an Organizer any Payment Data. “Payment Data” means any full credit card number or other full payment account number and the related expiration date and security code entered by an Attendee on the Services in order to purchase a ticket or registration, make a donation, so long as such information is entered in the fields under “Payment” on the order payment page. Note that if an Attendee enters such information in other areas of the Services or otherwise provides it to another User, it may not be encrypted and may be automatically shared with the applicable Organizer, so Attendees should enter such information only under “Payment” on the order payment page.
